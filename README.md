# cadito

A WIP API made to work with the Cadito example web application. This is just a drill meant to be presented as classword for a backend software class and does **IN NO WAY** represent best practices for proper backend web development.
God Forgive me for I have sinned.

By the way, this app is already deployed on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) under the name [`jespitaleta-cadito-backend`](https://jespitaleta-cadito-backend.herokuapp.com/).

You may use the link below on the frontend app to use a deployed version of the API, already connected to an MongoDB Atlas instance that you may use for testing.

You may also choose to clone the code and deploy it on your local machine yourself.
